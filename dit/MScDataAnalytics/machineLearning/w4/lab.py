# Q1.) Calculate the probability of a model ensemble that uses simple majority voting making an
# incorrect prediction in the following scenarios. (Hint: Understanding how to use the binomial
# distribution will be useful in answering this question.).
# 
# a.) The ensemble contains 11 independent models, all of which have an error rate of 0.2.
# 
# b.) The ensemble contains 11 independent models, all of which have an error rate of 0.49.
# 
# c.) The ensemble contains 21 independent models, all of which have an error rate of 0.49.

# Answer will be some formula for like: Probability that 6 or more are correct:
# p(6)+p(7)+p(8)+p(9)+p(10)+p(11)
