# Probability and Statistical Inference
> Summary of lectures

## Lecture 1 - 19/09/2018
> Introduction & Fundamentals

### Introduction

- (comic strips):
    - Data Analysys:
        - The gathering, display, and and summary of data.
    - Probability:
        - The laws of chances, in and out of the casino.
    - Statistica Inference
        - The science of Drawing statistical conclusions from specific data, using a knownkedge of probability.

- What is the module about:
    - For the purposes of a Statistical Inquiry
        - How to collect and prepare data for use
        - How to describe the data (in terms of format and statistically)
        - How to formulate, state, test and report on hypotheses
        - How to conduct exploratory and predictive analytics
        - How to use an appropriate software package 
            - We will be using R
        - How to report your findings correctly

- How to succeed in the module
    - Focus on learning the process of conducting a statistical analysis 
        - What are you trying to discover or show?
            - Figure out a question you are trying to answer/theory you are trying to test
        - What data do you need to collect?
        - Once you have data, how do you describe the data you have?  
            - You need to explain this to whoever will be the consumer of your work
        - What analysis should you conduct?
            - You need to know the types of tests to run and how to explain this to your consumer
        - How do you interpret your analysis?
            - You need to know how to interpret the outcomes of the analysis and present these to your consumer
        - How will you present your findings?
        - Present the question you are interested in 
            - In a way that makes sense to conduct a statistical analysis
        - Inspect and prepare the data you have 
            - To support a statistical analysis
        - Describe the data you have
            - In a way that your consumer can understand any constraints the data may put on your analysis
        - Conduct a statistical analysis
            - Using appropriate statistical tests
        - Report on your statistical analysis
            - In a way that makes sense for your consumer
        - Interpret the outcomes of your statistical analysis
            - Drawing appropriate conclusions
        - Report on the findings of your statistical analysis
            - In a way that makes sense for your consumer


### Fundamentals
- Types of Data Analysis
    - Qualitative Methods
        - Testing theories using language
    - Quantitative Methods
        - Testing theories using numbers (via statistics)
    - statistical inquiry:
        - science of collecting, analysing, and drawing conclusions from data
        - science of collecting, describing, and interpreting data.
        - objectively and quantitatively
