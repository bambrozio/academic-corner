# Exercises notes

- Analyses in SAS Enterprise Miner start by defining a project. A project is a container for a set of related analyses. After a project is defined, you define libraries and diagrams. A library is a collection of data sources that are accessible by the SAS Foundation Server. A diagram holds analyses for one or more data sources. Process flows are the specific steps that you use in your analysis of a data source. Each step in a process flow is indicated by a node. The nodes represent the SAS Enterprise Miner tools that are available to the user.
