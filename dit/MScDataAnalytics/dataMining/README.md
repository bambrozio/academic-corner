## Lecture 1 - 18/09/2018

- Data Mining:
    - Dataprocessingusingsophisticateddatasearchcapabilitiesandstatisticalalgorithmstodiscoverpatternsandcorrelationsinlarge preexisting databases; a way to discover new meaning in data.
    - The process of extracting patterns from data. It is commonly used in a wide range of profiling practices, such as marketing, surveillance, fraud detection and scientific discovery.
    - A technique for searching large-scale databases for patterns.
    - The process of identifying and extracting patterns from data, particularly from very large and/or complex sets of data.
    - A method of comparing large amounts of data to find patters. Normally this is used for models and forecasting.
    - Datamining (or data acquisition) is the process of autonomously retrieving useful information or knowledge (“actionable assets”) from large data stores or sets.
    - The extraction of patterns and other useful information from a corpus of data.
    - The process of analysing data in order to determine patterns and their relationships.
    - Using computers to analyze masses of information to discover trends and patterns.
    - Is the exploration and analysis of data in order to discover patterns, correlations and other regularities.
- Data Mining (Methods + Applications)
    - Looks at defining the business question being investigated, what data is related to that question, understanding that data, identifying appropriate techniques to use (eg. ML), analysing the results generated to apply domain knowledge, being able to related this back to the business, understanding how the results/models etc can be incorporated into the business processes, and monitor & updating the processes based on their performance on live data.
        - Looking to solve business problems
        - Combining many different technologies • Requires the human brain
        - Business understanding
        - How findings relate to business

- Machine Learning (Theory + Methods)
    - Focuses on the algorithms, how these work, how they can be customised, how they can be tuned, finding or discovering how they can be used in new situations.
    - Machine Learning is only **one component**(*) of Data Mining. (And only one of the tools you can use for the Modeling / Predictive Analytics phase)
        - Coding of algorithms
        - Designing of algorithms
        - Finding applications areas
